# Stroboscope

Stroboscope is an experimental iOS application that uses a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to analyze music
and uses the LED flashlight on an iPhone as a strobelight. Strobelights at professional EDM festivals that 
do this can be very expensive, so Stroboscope is intended to be a low budget proof of concept.

Stroboscope began development in the fall of 2013 and was completed in May 2014 as an entry into the WVU
App Challenge. Developed by two West Virginia University Computer Science students, Ricky Deal and 
Kaitlyn Landmesser, using Objective C. This was our first iOS application and Stroboscope won first prize
at the WVU App Challenge.

Currently, the app is not being worked on, but we want to completely rewrite it, when we have the time.
